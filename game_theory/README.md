# Game Theory Module Structure

## Week 1

**Topics:** General introduction to game theory, and core technical concepts of games - rational players, simultaneous **and sequential games** with their graphical representations, **backward induction**, nash equilibrium, excluding dominated strategies. (I suggest omitting or not going into much detail on higlighted topics)

Game theory:
- Normal-form games
- Pure Strategies
- Pareto efficiency

Programming:
- Pure strategy algorithm - *Which they must implement themselves*
- Arrays
- Pareto efficiency algorithm - *Which they must implement themselves*
